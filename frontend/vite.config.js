      This block adds what's known as a proxy from your frontend to your
      backend. Vite will take any requests that start with `/api` and forward
      them to your backend. For example, with this setting in place, if you
      try to access

      `http://localhost:5173/api`

      then your request will be sent to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and you'll see
      the response returned by that route. (Note that that the URL in your
      browser's address will remain `http://localhost:5173/api`.)

      If you've ever dealt with CORS errors when making requests from your
      frontend to your backend, this will prevent those from happening!
