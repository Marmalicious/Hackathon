"""
If you are deploying on Vercel, you can delete this file.

This app puts together the frontend UI and backend API for deployment on Render.
For local development, the app for just the API should be run on its own:
$ fastapi dev src/api.py

The provided Dockerfile will handle putting everything together for deployment.
When used, the application bundle from building the React app with `npm run build`
is placed at the public directory defined below for FastAPI to serve as static assets.
That means any requests for existing files will be served the contents of those files,
and any requests for the API paths will be sent to the API routes defined in the API.
